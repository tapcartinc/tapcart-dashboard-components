# Using Storybook Assets
<br/>

### Documentation (sidebar)

Explore the `Documentation` in the sidebar menu in order to reference documentation on each component or element. This is where all the information, props, and github links to each component or element will be located. Specifically for components, each Doc page contains one example of the linked component (reference current component mdx files when creating Documentation for new components).
It will look something like this... ```<Story id="examples-components-breadcrumbs--basic" />```.<br/><br/>


### Examples (sidebar)

Explore further examples of each of the components here. This is where prop implementation or special use cases might be displayed.<br/><br/>


### Canvas (top bar storybook tab)

Under the component examples in the sidebar, this is where extra examples and their code can be seen and utilized with raw code examples, knobs, etc.

  1. __Knobs:__ I've been adding a `withKnobs` story name under certain component examples to show which examples might provide knobs. Storybook knobs are pretty sweet for playing with the UI options on componeents in real time. [Reference storybook knobs here](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/master/addons/knobs).

  2. __Story:__ Shows you the raw code of the storybook file for the component. This can be helpful for wanting to reference code where the component has been used.<br/><br/>
