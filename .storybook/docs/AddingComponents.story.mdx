# Adding Components
<br/>

## File Structure

This is the general file/folder structure you should follow when building onto the component library with new components

Each component should consist of at least 4 files:
-index.js (Core functionality/structure and proptypes)
-styles.js (styling for the component)
-mdx file (documentation, contains detailed docs, api links per component, component props, an example component, etc)
-story file - index.stories.js (examples that go into the storybook for the library)

Example file structure:

```
Component
│   index.js
│   styles.js
│   index.stories.js
│   index.stories.mdx
│
└───ComponentChildOne
│   │   index.js
│   │   styles.js
│
└───ComponentChildTwo
│   │   index.js
│   │   styles.js
```

When creating new stories, you can include the styles for the stories that are not included within the component being exported inside of the `index.stories.js` file
