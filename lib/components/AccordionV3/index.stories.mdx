# AccordionV3

---

<Story id="examples-components-accordionv3--push" />
<br />

An Accordion component consists of a parent container with a label and body for each AccordionPanel.
This component can take it's own design, style entirely or follow the reusable step-by-step pattern from the push form.
There are a variety of prop options that enhance the functionality of the Accordion.

Examples of where this is used in the Merchant Dashboard:
* Push form
* Menu builder

<br />

## Quick Start
To create an Accordion, use import the `AccordionV3` component; this component must include child panels that accept an AccordionLabel
and an AccordionBody. Each AccordionV3Panel must be given an id prop in the order of where it is in the parent componet (Accordion).

```jsx
const MyAccordion = () => (
  <AccordionV3 steps includeBorder spacing={20} panelHeight={65} includeArrows>
    <AccordionV3Panel id={1}>
      <AccordionLabel>
        label one
      </AccordionLabel>
    <AccordionPanelBody>
        body one
    </AccordionPanelBody>
    </AccordionV3Panel>
    <AccordionV3Panel id={2}>
      <AccordionLabel>
        label two
      </AccordionLabel>
    <AccordionPanelBody>
        body two
    </AccordionPanelBody>
    </AccordionV3Panel>
  </AccordionV3>
);
```
