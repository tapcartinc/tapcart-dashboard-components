# Toggle

This component is a custom, reusable toggle switch. The Toggle component is most commonly used to reflect
some specific state value as a bool inside of a form.

Examples of where this is used in the Merchant Dashboard:
* Settings
* Multi-Page support block

<br />

## Quick Start
To create a Toggle switch, use import the `Toggle`; this component must include child panels that accept an AccordionLabel
and an AccordionBody. Each AccordionV3Panel must be given an id prop in the order of where it is in the parent componet (Accordion).

```jsx
const MyToggle = () => (
  <Toggle
    type="basic"
    id="toggle"
    toggleState={toggle}
    onChange={setToggle(!toggle)}
  />
);
```
