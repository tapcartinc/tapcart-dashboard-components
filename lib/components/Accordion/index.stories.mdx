# Accordion

---
<br />
<Story id="examples-components-accordion--push"  />
<br />

An Accordion component consists of a parent container with a label and body for each AccordionPanel.
This component can take it's own design, style entirely or follow the reusable step-by-step pattern from the push form.
There are a variety of prop options that enhance the functionality of the Accordion.

<em>Examples of where this is used in the Merchant Dashboard:</em>

* -Push form
* -Menu builder

<br />

## Quick Start
To create an Accordion, use import the <pre>`Accordion`</pre> component; this component must include child panels that accept an AccordionLabel
and an AccordionBody. Each AccordionPanel must be given an id prop in the order of where it is in the parent componet (Accordion).


## Accordion Example:

```jsx
const MyAccordion = () => (
  <Accordion steps includeBorder spacing={20} panelHeight={65} includeArrows>
    <AccordionPanel id={1}>
      <AccordionLabel>
        label one
      </AccordionLabel>
    <AccordionBody>
        body one
    </AccordionBody>
    </AccordionPanel>
    <AccordionPanel id={2}>
      <AccordionLabel>
        label two
      </AccordionLabel>
    <AccordionBody>
        body two
    </AccordionBody>
    </AccordionPanel>
  </Accordion>
);
```
