# Icon

Use the Icon component by importing it and setting the type of the icon with the type component.

### Adding new icons to the library

Please note that the icons in the icon index.js file and the story file are listed in alphabetical order. Please keep this strucutre to make it easier for other devs to update Icon components and add to the library without duplicating icons that have already been made. Also be sure to check the story file prior to adding the icon in case the icon already exists. Remember that if it does exist but is a different color, this is handled by adjusting the `fill` prop.


All icons for story purposes are listed in alphabetical order in the `GalleryContainer.js` file. This is all you need to do to add new icons to the icon storybook file.
