### **Layout Components**

The following components are crucial to the layout/themeing consistency of the marketing website

## [ThemeProvider](/?path=/docs/layout-themeprovider--theme-provider)

This component provides a theme to all React components underneath itself via the context API.

`ThemeProvider` is not necessary for the layout of the content within each `Section` component.


## [Section](/?path=/docs/layout-section--section)

Wrapper component containing each segment of content from `Container` to children of `Column` components.

The `Section` component takes props that are crucial to the layout of the currect section and it's children


## [Container](/?path=/docs/layout-container--container)

Wrapper component that adds the correct amount of padding around the content from desktop to mobile screens


## Row

Component that contains columns as its immediate children

Responsible for much of the responsiveness and breakpoints of the designs


## [Column](/?path=/docs/layout-column--column)

The individual sections within each `Row`
